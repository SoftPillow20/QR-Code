## My process

- I choose this challenge because of it's simplicity, yet enough to be engaging for a beginner level front-end developer. 
  Throught the process of developing this website, I come across different problems that I was able to manage with different solutions
  and it was rewarding after finishing this small project. However, there are also some problems that I cannot seem to fix and I know I
  can fixed it if given enough time; but I think it is better that the project is close enough to its original so I can pinpoint the problems
  and to have better understanding of the solutions I may come up with.  

  In my process of building this website, I mainly use flexbox, position: relative and position: absolute. The flexbox was to center the whole
  QR code to the page and the position was to position the QR image and its content.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

- I am currently in the process of mastering the use of CSS or making myself familiar enough to make websites confidently. One of the technique
  I learned was the nested layout technique. I learned this from a youtube channel called SuperSimpleDev and it was a huge helped for me because it taught me 
  how to visualize the website through its div. 

### Useful resources

- [HTML & CSS Full Course - Beginner to Pro (2022)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc) - 
 This is the youtube video that I really liked because of how great the constructor giving side projects after completing every part of his tutorials. 
 He was also very indepth in his teaching and it was easy enough to understand all of the things that he taught.
